CHG0019243 MCS SILVER - Adjust NFS Mount Options for File based PVCs

**When?**

Starting at 13:00 on Oct 26th and finishing at 15:00.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

No impact to running apps.

**Do I need to do anything?**

Once the change is completed you should restart any pods using `netapp-file-standard` PVCs to have the volumes remounted with the new settings.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
