CHG0054590 STMS NET - Interior - Insert new Arista Spine and Service Leaf (Core switch)

This work will replace hardware responsible for acting as the core switch in the Kamloops datacentre, and will disrupt network services for the Openshift Silver, Gold, and Emerald clusters.

More information in the TIB [KB0033041](https://ociomysc.service-now.com/sp?id=kb_article&table=u_kb_template_technical_information_bulletin&sys_id=c46c81b91b3af5109230ba215b4bcb1f&view=ess).

A change like this was previously completed in Calgary on Sept 24th.

**When?**

Starting at Sunday January 21st at 4:00am PDT. The change window ends at 9:00am PDT in case of roll-back, and the estimation for network disruption is estimated to be between 45 minutes or less during the early stages of this change window.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

This will have an impact on the Openshift clusters in terms of being able to access workloads outside of the cluster. This includes access to/from the internet, access to DNS resolution, and access to other clusters or parts of the datacenter.

Internal DNS queries in the cluster involving internal service routes will resolve, but no external DNS queries will otherwise work during the impactful portion of this change.

**Do I need to do anything?**

If you are on Gold, you may want to preemptively fail over to Gold DR for the weekend, and fail back on Monday after checking the health of your Gold app.
