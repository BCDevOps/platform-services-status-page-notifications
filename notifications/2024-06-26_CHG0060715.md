**What is happening?**

CHG0060715 - CITZ - SILVER - Drain MCS-SILVER-APP-21.DMZ in order to address hardware management issues

In order to protect user workloads, we will be draining a single SILVER worker node so that involved parties may address some internal integration issues discovered affecting our ability to automate vendor case creation when a hardware failure event occurs.

**When?**

Starting at 9am Wednesday June 26th 2024 and finishing before 4pm the same day, though actual time required should be significantly less than the alloted change window.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

Pods on the involved node will be drained, using the same procedure as when we do patching. The pods should restart automatically onto other nodes.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
