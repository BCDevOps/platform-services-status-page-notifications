**What is happening?**

CHG0053752 MCS - Support ESXi patching on the SILVER cluster with the VMWare team

Node drains to support ESXi patching

**When?**

Starting Monday Nov 6th at 09:00 and running until Friday Nov 10th at 17:00

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

Nodes will be drained one at a time, causing pods to restart onto other nodes. Should be minimally disruptive to apps designed to be highly available.

**Do I need to do anything?**

Nope

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
