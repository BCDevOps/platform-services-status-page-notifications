**What is happening?**

CHG0053691 STMS NET - CAL - MCS connections to move to NEW Spine

The dedicated switches for the Gold DR servers and their NetApp will be moved from the old core to the new core.

**When?**

Starting at Tuesday Nov 14th at 18:00 until 21:00

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

No impact is expected. The servers and NetApp are redundantly connected to two switches. The switches will be moved one at a time and traffic flowing through the core will be able to connect via the other switch while work is happening.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
