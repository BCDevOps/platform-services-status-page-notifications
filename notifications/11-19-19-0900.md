Tuesday Nov 19 @ 9am

There is a known, but so far unsolved bug with Gluster Block storage where it leaks a 64Mi file each time a volume is deleted. Eventually these pile up and cause volume provisioning errors. The workaround is to just restart the gluster block services so they can release and delete the files.

This RFC will restart those services. We've done this one before without issue or impact.
