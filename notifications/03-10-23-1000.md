**What is happening?**

CHG0046526 CITZ MCS - SILVER Swap out worker nodes

10 of the physical worker nodes in SILVER have reached end of life and are being replaced by 20 virtual machine worker nodes. This will drain the old nodes and move those pods onto the new nodes.

**When?**

Starting at Tuesday March 14 @ 09:00 and finishing at 16:00

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

Similar to our regular OpenShift patching, nodes will be drained and pods will be restarted onto other nodes.

**Do I need to do anything?**

As usual, monitor your applications to ensure they handle any pod moves and recover properly.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
