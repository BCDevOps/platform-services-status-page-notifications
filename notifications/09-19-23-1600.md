**What is happening?**

CHG0052434 CITZ MCS - GOLDDR - Build new app nodes, make active and remove old nodes

Old physical app nodes are being retired and replaced with new VM worker nodes. Old nodes will be drained and pods will restart on the new nodes.

**When?**

Starting at Monday Sept 25th @ 09:00 and finishing before Wednesday Sept 27th @ 16:00

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

About half of the pods will be restarted and land on new nodes.

**Do I need to do anything?**

Monitor your DR apps to ensure its ready in case of a fail over.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
