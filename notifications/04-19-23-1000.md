CHG0047538- MCS - Updating  global pull secret in EMERALD Cluster

**When?**

Starting on Wednesday April 19th @ 1000 until 1200, the global pull secret in openshift-config namespace for the EMERALD cluster will be updated.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

No impact to running applications, though application owners should still monitor their apps for the duration of this RFC change window

**Do I need to do anything?**

As usual, monitor your applications to ensure they handle any image pulls.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
