CHG0019238 - MCS - Adjust Load Balancer Settings

Update load balancer settings for MCS Silver cluster

**When?**

Starting at 9am on Oct 27th and finishing at 10am.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

No impact expected. This is just changing the settings of already existing VIPs and they should remain functional throughout the change.

**Do I need to do anything?**

Nope!

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
