**What is happening?**

CHG0054991 CITZ MCS SILVER - Adjust HAProxy Settings

This will change the router pods config reload interval from 5 seconds to 15 seconds and set a maximum connection lifetime of 6 hours.

**When?**

Starting at 6:00AM Wednesday Jan 3rd and running until 9:00am

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

As the router pods are highly available and traffic is load balanced by an F5, no outage is expected as the pods restart one at a time.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
