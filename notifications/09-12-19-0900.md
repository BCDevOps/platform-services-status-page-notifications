
*RFC185298 MCS - Remove unused IPs from HAProxy router*

Thursday September 12 at 9am

Currently the OpenShift router is using 10 IPs, 142.34.143.180 to .190. But the load balancer is only directing traffic at .180. As we expand the cluster we need more IPs for additional nodes.

This RFC will change the IP Failover DeploymentConfig to just use 142.34.143.180 . Web traffic may fail over between the router nodes, but no impact should be felt.
