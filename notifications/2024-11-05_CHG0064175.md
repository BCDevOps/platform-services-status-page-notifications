Hi @all, your attention is needed! 

**What is happening?**

CHG0064175 STMS NET - CAL KAM MCS - Arista EOS Upgrade MCS Network Switches

The network switches used for production traffic on Silver, Gold, and Gold DR will have their firmware upgraded.

**When?**

Starting at 6pm PST Nov 5th and finishing before 10pm.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

No, no downtime is expected at the time, for questions post in #devops-operations

Each physical server is redundantly connected to two switches and only one switch at a time will be offline for firmware updates.

Gold DR will be completed first, then Silver and Gold will be completed in parallel.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/rocketchat/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
