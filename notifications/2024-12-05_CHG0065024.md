Hi @all, your attention is needed! 

**What is happening?**

CHG0065024 CITZ MCS EMERALD - Clean up AVI TLS profiles

Do some manual cleanup of intermediate and root TLS certificates in the AVI load balancer

**When?**

Starting at Thursday, Dec 5 at 6:00 AM and finishing by 8:00 AM

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

No impact to Routes is expected, but may occur as we re-arrange the TLS certs on the load balancer to have a correct hierarchy.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/rocketchat/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
