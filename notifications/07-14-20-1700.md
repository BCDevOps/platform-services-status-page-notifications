**What is happening?**

RFC 196031

MCS PROD - Upgrade Trident to version 20.04.0

**When?**

Starting at Tuesday July 14th @ 1700 and finishing at Tuesday July 14th @ 1900.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

Yes, We expect a brief interruption to the ability to provision Netapp storage. This should not impact already running pods or applications. Expected time of provisioning outage is under 10 minutes.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No. There should be no impact to running pods or applications. If you are deploying pods during this timeframe it may take a moment for any newly requested netapp volumes to appear, or you may need to make the request again.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
