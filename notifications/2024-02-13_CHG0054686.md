**What is happening?**

CHG0054686 STMS NET - Interior Openshift Gold F5 load balancer upgrade software version to 15.1.10.2 to remediate vulnerability

The F5 used for Routes and the API will be failed over as each side is upgraded.

**When?**

Starting at Tuesday February 13th at 05:00AM until 08:00AM

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

No impact is expected as the load balancers are a high available active-passive pair. At 6am the first failover will occur, promoting the patched secondary to active. Then after the primary is patched there will be a fail back to it around 06:30am.

Long lasting TCP connections will be interrupted and need to be re-established after each failover.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action is required

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
