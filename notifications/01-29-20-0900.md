
**RFC190393 CITZ - PROD MCS - Renew EFK certificates before they expire**

On Wednesday January 29th at 09:00am PST a vendor playbook will be executed that will renew self-signed certificates responsible for the EFK Logging component to ensure involved services remain active. 

The playbook will restart involved pods in sequence thus ensuring the EFK Logging service will remain available during the certificate replacement.

An update will be posted once the maintenance is complete.
