# New storage provider!

We thank everyone for reducing requests for the gluster-* storageClasses over the last few months to help with the capacity juggling.  We will no longer be offering quota in the gluster-file, gluster-file-db and gluster-block storageClasses as of **January 7th, 2020**.  Existing volumes of these types will **NOT** be affected.  (Note: a reduction in the gluster storage quota for your project will NOT remove access to existing PVCs, however provisioning new PVCs in those storageClasses will be limited to the new netapp storageClasses.)

The new NetApp storage provider is ready to take your provisioning requests!  You are now able to provision 2 new types of storageClasses in your project.  These storageClasses are available immediately with appropriate project storage quotas.

- **netapp-file-standard**: Is the new default storageClass and can be used for most of your storage needs.
- **netapp-block-standard**: Is the new recommended storage for applications that require block storage.

If your pipeline creates new PVCs, you will need to modify it to specify a corresponding netapp-* storageClass.  If the PVC already exists, deployments will use the pre-existing PVC regardless of the storageClass defined in the configuration.

Please reach out to the platform services team for quota related questions or assistance.  (https://chat.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/channel/devops-platform-services)
