# New storage provider!

Thanks to everyone for reducing requests for the gluster-* storageClasses over the last few months to help with the capacity juggling.  We'll no longer be offering quota in the gluster-file, gluster-file-db and gluster-block storageClasses as of **January 7th, 2020**.  Don't worry, existing volumes of these types will **NOT** be affected.

The new NetApp storage provider is ready to take your provisioning requests!  You are now able to provision 2 new types of storageClasses in your project.  These storageClasses are available immediately with appropriate project storage quotas.

- **netapp-file-standard**: Is the new default storageClass and can be used for most of your storage needs.
- **netapp-block-standard**: Is the new recommended storage for applications that require block storage.

Please note: If your pipeline creates new PVCs, you will need to modify it to specify a corresponding netapp-* storageClass.  If the PVC already exists, deployments will use the pre-existing PVC regardless of the storageClass defined in the configuration.

Please reach out to the platform services team for quota related questions or assistance.  (https://chat.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/channel/devops-platform-services)
