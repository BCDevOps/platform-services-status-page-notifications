**What is happening?**

CHG0057501 CITZ MCS SILVER - Reduce number of HAProxy Routers

We will be reducing the number of router pods in Silver from 6 to 3 over three days.

**When?**

Starting on Tuesday March 12th at 6:00am and again at 6:00am on Wednesday and Thursday

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

No impacts are expected. Long running connections to routes on Silver may be terminated but can reconnect to another router pod.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
