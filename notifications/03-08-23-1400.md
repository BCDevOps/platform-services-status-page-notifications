**What is happening?**

CHG0046450 - MCS - Apply updated Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security internal certificates to SILVER, GOLD, GOLDDR and EMERALD clusters

**When?**

Starting on Tuesday March 21st @ 0900 the internal certificates for the PROD RHACS cluster(s) will be updated.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

There may be a brief inability to view the Advanced Cluster Security console as these are updated but it's expected to remain working while these certificates are updated.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required from product teams.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
