
**RFC 186549 - MCS - Update node service log levels on PROD App nodes**

Wednesday October 16 at 9am PDT

AdvSol will be upgrading the log levels for the `atomic-openshift-node` service on the PROD App nodes. This is in response to a vendor (Red Hat) request for additional log levels to be applied for the sake of additional troubleshooting data involving an ongoing case. The change itself will not be impactful to the user workloads or overall cluster stability.

A notice will be posted here once the change is complete.
