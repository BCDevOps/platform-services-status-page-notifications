**What is happening?**

CHG0045954 - MCS - PROD Replace GOLDDR MASTER nodes with new hardware

As the hardware currently used by the master servers has reached end of life (it was repurposed from the 3.11 cluster), we will be replacing the nodes one at a time in sequence with new Dell servers.

**When?**

Starting at Sunday March 19th @ 06:00 AM and running until 23:00 at most. We expect this will only take about 2 hours, but made the change window large in case we need the extra time.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

There will be short disruptions to the clusters API as the load balancer detects the nodes going down and coming back up.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required from product teams

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
