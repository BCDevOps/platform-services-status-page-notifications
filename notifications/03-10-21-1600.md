**What is happening?**

CHG0023944 MCS SILVER - Add additional infra nodes into load balancer

**When?**

Starting at 06:00 on Thursday March 11th and finishing before 09:00 

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

While we are expecting this to be non-disruptive, it does involve changes to the OpenShift Ingress Routers and so some outages to application routes may occur.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action by app teams is required.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
