**What is happening?**

CHG0057012 - CITZ - PRODUCTION ACS - Refresh credentials integrating all production ACS clusters with SILVER

This change is a required maintenance activity performed yearly which will refresh the credentials used for the main ACS (Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes) cluster on SILVER to orchestrate/manage the ACS clusters on the remaining production Openshift clusters.

**When?**

Starting Wednesday February 28th 2024 after 9:00am and going if required until Thursday February 29th 2024 before 5:00pm.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

This change does not involve running workloads at all. There should be no impact either for users who make use of ACS (https://acs.developer.gov.bc.ca/) either since internal automation will cycle through updating the new credentials for all of the production ACS clusters over the span of several hours.

**Do I need to do anything?**

Nothing needs to be done as the result of this maintenance activity.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app does not work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
