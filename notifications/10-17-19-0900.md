
**RFC 186579 - MCS - Update VMWare latency sensitivity PROD Master nodes**

Thursday October 17 at 9am PDT

AdvSol will be shutting down in sequence the three PROD master nodes to allow the VMWare team to adjust the latency for each VM in sequence to settings approved by best practices. Care will be taken to fail API calls over to the other nodes before taking down each node to ensure uptime of services.

A notice will be posted here once the change is complete.
