**What is happening?**

CHG0052782 STMS NET - Calgary - Migrate EXT01, EXT03, IPS & SWC02 to new Arista Service Leaf switches - Correct Link Speed between Spines & MELs

**When?**

Starting on Sunday December 10th 2023 at 6:00am PST and running until 9:00am at the latest.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

There will be an impact to network traffic to/from the Openshift GOLDDR server a couple of times for a short period during the change window.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required unless you have workloads on the GOLDDR cluster to check on post-change.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
