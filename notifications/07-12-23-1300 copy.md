**What is happening?**

CHG0050202 STMS NET - INT - Relocate hpasbckam1460lb20 (GSLB) to new location in datacentre

This will be physically relocating the Kamloops LB 20 that supports the GSLB services from the existing rack to a new physical rack. This will be a fail over event â€“ traffic will flow through the LB20 in Calgary while LB 20 in Kamloops is down.

**When?**

Starting at Wednesday July 19th @ 03:30 AM and finishing by 05:30 AM

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

No impact to users is expected as traffic will be routed from the Kamloops GSLB to the Calgary GSLB first, then return to the Kamloops GSLB after the rack movement.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
