**What is happening?**

CHG0039431 - CITZ - GOLD - Apply vendor-requested configuration changes to master controller pods

This change is to adjust how the master nodes access the API, switching from going through the F5 to directly from localhost. 

**When?**

This Wednesday July 20th @ 0900.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

This change shouldn't be disruptive to users as it will roll out the change one node at a time. It should take under an hour to complete and won't result in any pod restarts. This has been successfully tested in the LAB.

**Do I need to do anything?**

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
