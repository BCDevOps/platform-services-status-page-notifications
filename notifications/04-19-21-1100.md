Quarterly image registry cleanup

**When?**

Starting at Sunday April 25 @ 6:00 AM and running for up to 3 hours.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

Builds will not be able to push new images to the registry.

Image pulls to start new pods will continue to work fine.

**Do I need to do anything?**

Don't run any builds during the change.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
