This evening  (Tuesday February 5th 2020 after 06::00pm PST) we will be migrating the contents of the existing Metrics block storage to a replacement PVC with double the original capacity. This will address ongoing growth concerns which are causing us to come close to exhausting the current PVC disk space.

Regular workloads will not be affected due to this maintenance. Users looking at metrics data for pods within the web console will not be able to do so during the maintenance, and users with Horizontal Pod Autoscaling configured will also receive messages from Openshift stating a lack of metrics data as well, but workloads will still function during the maintenance.

An final update will be posted in #devops-alerts once the maintenance is complete.
