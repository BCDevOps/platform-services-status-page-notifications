**What is happening?**

CHG0030690 GOLDDR - NetApp Storage Cluster CDOT OS Upgrade

This change will upgrade the Operating System the NetApp hardware runs on, and this change will perform this for the GOLDDR cluster.

**When?**

This Sunday (January 9th 2022) from 8am to 12pm PST.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

Depending on timing, pods using Block storage may delay on restart during the NetApp upgrade depending on the state of the upgrade process, resulting in a delay of up to 15 minutes. Existing pods running with Block storage that are not restarted during the change window will not be affected. No such issues exist for File volumes.

**Do I need to do anything?**

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
