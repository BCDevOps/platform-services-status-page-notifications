**When?**

Starting at Wednesday Aug 2nd at 2:30 AM and finishing before 5:30 AM

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

These are the Intrusion Prevention Systems inspecting the Gold DR clusters network traffic. No impact is expected as they are a redundant pair and will be moved one at a time.

**Do I need to do anything?**

Nope

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
