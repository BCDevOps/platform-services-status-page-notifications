
**RFC191779 CITZ - PROD MCS - Enable LLDP on all PROD node network interfaces**

This afternoon (Thursday February 27th 2020 starting at 1:00pm PST) we will be installing and configuring a network service (LLDP) which will communicate directly to upstream network equipment and thus afford increased visibility by the DXC Network team when creating RFCs for network maintenance since they will be able to identify which servers are plugged into which switch ports and thus allow us to present more accurate information to you all about potential impact going forward.

The change itself is not disruptive to the node uptimes or workloads since the network protocol is binding to the physical network interfaces, and not the SDN network. This update was previously implemented against a LAB cluster with no identified issues.

An final update will be posted once the maintenance is complete.
