
**RFC 186664 - MCS - Restart OCS Block volume services to free semi-deleted files**

Friday October 18 at 9am PDT

AdvSol will be restarting specific gluster block services in each of the glusterfs pods in sequence so as to release a block on files which cannot be fully removed after the deletion of a volume. There will be no impact to gluster file services or active provisioning of volumes in general.

A notice will be posted here once the change is complete.
