**What is happening?**

CHG0022465 MCS - Drain pods from ociopf-p-209.dmz, ociopf-p-210.dmz, ociopf-p-211.dmz and ociopf-p-212.dmz

Drain pods from the nodes in preparation for decommissioning nodes. Node drains will be completed in sequence to minimize disruption as pods are migrated to new hosts.

**When?**

Starting at Friday February 5th at 0900.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

As long as your application is designed to be highly available there should be no impact as your pods are restarted onto other hosts.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
