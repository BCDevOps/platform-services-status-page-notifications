**What is happening?**
CHG0041445 - MCS SILVER - Upgrade Cluster Logging to 5.5.2

This change is an upgrade of Cluster Logging to version 5.5.2 to correct a bug that prevents viewing some audit logging data.

**When?**

 CHG0041445 for the SILVER cluster will start on Tuesday October 4th at 0900.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

This change will briefly make Kibana and Cluster Logging unavailable. The length of time depends on the size of the cluster and the volume of logs, so it is expected that the SILVER upgrade could cause Kibana to be unavailable for up to an hour, and logs to be delayed for up to an hour as well.

**Do I need to do anything?**

Monitor your applications to ensure they continue working as expected.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app does not work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
