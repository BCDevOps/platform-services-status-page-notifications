On Wednesday February 5th 2020 at 09:00am PST a custom playbook will be executed that will apply a highly-recommended custom systemd package meant to address ongoing stability concerns where systemd would over time consume large amounts of RAM and become unstable, thus requiring ongoing node evacuations and reboots. The custom systemd package will apply a version of system with hotfixes that stabilize the RAM consumption. Earlier versions of this custom package have been successfully applied against other PROD nodes in previous weeks, and the newest version of systemd will be tested and confirmed against the LAB environment earlier this week.

The playbook will be evacuating/rebooting APP nodes in turn during business hours. To start, we plan on addressing the nodes named `ociopf-p-181.dmz` through `ociopf-p-192.dmz` on the first day, and then the rest the following day (`ociopf-p-193.dmz` through `ociopf-p-204.dmz`). If these intended goals are not met, we will of course update in #devops-alerts the actual range of nodes patched, and nodes remaining for next business day.

An final update will be posted once the maintenance is complete.
