**What is happening?**

Advsol CHG0019119 - PROD OCP upgrade to 3.11.286

**When?**

Starting at 0900 on October 31st and proceeding until November 13th if necessary.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

The work that may have performance impacts will be completed outside of office hours. For the application nodes, these will be completed during work hours so that users can monitor their applications/pods as the App nodes are drained and updated.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No. In most instances the pods will reschedule to a new node. During the APP update process it is possible some applications may experience a brief outage as they are moved to a new node. Please monitor your applications during this process.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Getting-human-support-for-issues-not-covered-by-devops-requests)
