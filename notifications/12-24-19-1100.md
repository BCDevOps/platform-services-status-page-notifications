**RFC 189265 - CITZ - PROD MCS - INC0028970 - Evacuate and reboot 2 Openshift nodes to fix systemd**

At 1100 December 24th we will be evacuating and rebooting ociopf-p-191.dmz and ociopf-p-195.dmz to correct an issue with systemd memory usage.
This process should be minimally impactful as it is expected that evacuated pods will be rescheduled to other active compute nodes. We will update once this work has been completed.
