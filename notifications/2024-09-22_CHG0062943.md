**What is happening?**

CHG0062943 STMS NET - F5 Load balancer Kamloops R10900 Renew Device license

The SILVER and GOLD F5 used for Routes and the API will be failed over as each side is updated.

**When?**

Starting at Sunday September 22th at 06:00AM PDT until 09:00AM if required.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

No impact is expected as the load balancers are a high available active-passive pair. Two failovers are expected as each F5 physical node is worked on, each failover event is expected to take less than 30 seconds each.

Long lasting TCP connections will be interrupted and need to be re-established after each failover.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action is required.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/)
