MySC CHG0021942

Q1 Quarterly OS patches for the Openshift 3.11 PROD cluster

**When?**

Starting at 9:00am PDT on Saturday February 20th and concluding as late as March 5th if necessary.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

Some infrastructure services like metrics and Kibana will be briefly unavailable or have reduced performance during some operations. The app nodes will be drained in sequence during the weekdays and pods may experience some brief outages as pods are moved between nodes.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No. Monitor the health of your apps during the change. Refer to [Post-Outage Application Checklist](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Post-Outage-Application-Health-Checklist) for health check tips.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
