**What is happening?**

RFC194136 MCS - Update Sysdig Agent settings - 42 SERVERS

We will be updating some setting on the Sysdig agents used to gather metrics from the platform to improve their performance.

**When?**

Starting at Tuesday May 12 @ 09:00 AM and running until 16:00 if needed.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

No impact to workloads is expected.

**Do I need to do anything?**

Nope!

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
