CHG0059536 CITZ MCS SILVER - Drain 3 nodes and mark them for AI usage

This will drain the current pods off of three nodes and set them aside to be used exclusively by the new OpenShift AI operator.

**When?**

Starting at 9am Thursday May 16 and finishing before 4pm

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

Pods on the three nodes will be drained, using the same procedure as when we do patching. The pods should restart automatically onto other nodes.

Ipmacted nodes:

- mcs-silver-app-36.dmz
- mcs-silver-app-37.dmz
- mcs-silver-app-38.dmz

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
