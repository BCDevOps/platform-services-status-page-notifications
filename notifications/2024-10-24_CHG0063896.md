**What is happening?**

CHG0063896 - CITZ - Drain and shut down 11 servers

To save some costs, we will be removing some capacity from the clusters

**When?**

Starting at 9am Thursday October 24th and completing before 5pm

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

Pods will be drained from the affected nodes, similar to OpenShift patching. The nodes will then be deleted from the cluster and decommissioned.

Nodes:

- mcs-silver-app-71.dmz
- mcs-silver-app-72.dmz
- mcs-silver-app-73.dmz
- mcs-silver-app-74.dmz
- mcs-silver-app-75.dmz
- mcs-silver-app-76.dmz
- mcs-gold-app-12.dmz
- mcs-gold-app-13.dmz
- mcs-golddr-app-21.dmz
- mcs-emerald-app-07.dmz
- mcs-emerald-app-08.dmz

**Do I need to do anything?**

Please monitor your apps to ensure the pods restart correctly and that your PDBs are not blocking any drains.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
