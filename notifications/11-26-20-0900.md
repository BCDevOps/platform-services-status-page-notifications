**What is happening?**

CHG0020388 - PROD OCP 3.11 ES components upgrade from 3.11.286 to 3.11.318

As suggested in RedHat case 02804895, ES components 3.11.286 should be updated by 3.11.318 to resolve [the Kibana connectivity issue](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/platform-experience-5bb7c5ab4b5806bc2beb9d15/issues/bcdevops/developer-experience/736). 

(This is supported by the RedHat's case 02804895.)

**When?**

Starting at 0900 on November 26th until completed through the same day, 1600 (4 PM).

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

No impact to running apps is expected. Kibana may go down as its config changes and may be a bit slow as ElasticSearch resyncs itself.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action is required. If your app is highly available then no impacts should be noticed.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
