**What is happening?**

CHG0028260 MCS Silver - Set Up F5 Container Integration Service
CHG0028265 MCS Gold - Set Up F5 Container Integration Service
CHG0028266 MCS Gold DR - Set Up F5 Container Integration Service

As part of the goal of being able to connect to non-HTTP services in OpenShift this change will install the F5 Container Integration Service operator (CIS).

**When?**

Starting at Wednesday July 27 @ 10:00 and finishing 12:00

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

Nothing is currently relying on the CIS connector. The CIS makes API calls to a separate partition in the F5 so there is no risk of conflicts with the current config for API or apps HTTP traffic.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
