**What is happening?**

CHG0025476 - CITZ - MCS PROD - Drain nodes 183/184/199/200 in preparation for decommission

Drain four APP nodes in 3.11 PROD to prepare for decommissioning the hardware.

**When?**

Starting at Thursday April 29th 2021 starting after 9am PDT and not expected to take more than one hour.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

No expected impact for apps still residing on 3.11 cluster and built with higher redundancy. Single pod workloads will still be affected by the node drain as replacement pods spin up.


**Do I need to do anything?**

No direct action required. Do check your apps if they still reside on the 3.11 cluster after this work is completed to ensure your app is running as expected.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
