RFC193087 MCS - Enable Automatic Egress IPs

Minor change to the networking of the Infra nodes to support [Automatic Egress IPs](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/admin_guide/managing_networking.html#admin-guide-automatic-egress-ip)

**When?**

Starting at Wednesday April 8th @ 17:00 and finishing at 19:00

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

Based on testing in the LAB, no impact is expected.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
