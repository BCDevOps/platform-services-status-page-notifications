Hi @all, your attention is needed! 

**What is happening?**

CHG0064533 - CITZ - MCS - Drain, update firmware, and drain power on remaining GOLDDR nodes

Proactive firmware updates on remaining physical nodes in the GOLDDR Openshift cluster to address potential hardware stability concerns.

**When?**

Starting this Wednesday (November 13th 2024) after 9:00am PST and completing before 3:00pm the same day.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

Yes, there will be an impact on individual workloads (pods) hosted on the involved nodes as part of node drains, but not an impact on applications provided they are configured with High Availability in mind.

For questions post in #devops-operations

**Do I need to do anything?**

No

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/rocketchat/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
