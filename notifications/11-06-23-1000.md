**What is happening?**

CHG0052814 STMS NET - Calgary - Move Load Balancer LB21/LB22 to the new Arista Service Leaf switches

Gold DR load balancers will be failed over

**When?**

Starting at Wednesday Nov 8th at 00:30 and ending before 05:30

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

No impact is expected as the Load Balancers will be gracefully failed over. Long running TCP connections may be interrupted and need to be re-established.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
