# RFC183996 - Maintenance on Storage node ociopf-p-160.dmz to replace faulty NIC
This work intends to start at 5:00pm PDT on Friday August 9th. Existing storage will remain online during the work, but volumes with a brick residing on the node in question will not be able to be deleted until the node is available again.

We will post on Rocket Chat when the maintenance work is completed - current estimate will have the work taking no more than two hours, and will update accordingly if the work is going to exceed that time frame.
