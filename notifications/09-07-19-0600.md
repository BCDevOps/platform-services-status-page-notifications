# RFC181352 - Maintenance - Openshift Container Storage Upgrade to v3.11.3

This work intends to start at 6:00am PDT on Saturday September 7th 2019. For that day, for between 6-8 hours, no self-serve provisioning will be possible within Openshift due to ensure the heketi database is not out of sync with glusteri or other possible corruption concerns. We will also be finishing off at the same time the OS patching for the Openshift Container Storage nodes so as to reduce the number of times we will impact stakeholders using the services involved.

The work will then conclude during business hours the following week starting Monday August 9th at 9:00am PDT. The remaining work continuing at this date will not impact self-serve provisioning at all, and instead involve sequential worker node evacuation while we upgrade client gluster software on all of the worker nodes.

Status updates will be posted to Rocket Chat #devops-alerts during the execution of the above mentioned work.
