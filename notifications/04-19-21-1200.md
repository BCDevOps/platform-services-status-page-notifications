**What is happening?**

CHG0025038 MCS SILVER - 2021 Q2 Patching - Upgrade to OCP 4.6.21

**When?**

Starting at Monday April 26 @ 9:00 AM and finishing by Friday April 30 @ 5:00 PM

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

Nodes will be drained serially causing pods to be restarted. Each node may undergo several reboots to pick up software and firmware changes.

During master node reboots, there will be short interruptions (15-30 seconds) to the API as the load balancer detects the missing node and redirects traffic.

**Do I need to do anything?**

Monitor your applications to ensure they are resilient to node reboots.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
