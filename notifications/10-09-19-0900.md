Wednesday October 9 at 9am

AdvSol will be installing [Aporeto](https://github.com/BCDevOps/platform-services/tree/master/security/aporeto) into the production cluster. All existing projects will be given some base `NetworkSecurityPolicy` objects that will allow the same network traffic as is allowed now. Between pods in the project, between pods and the API server (for builds), and between pods and the internet.
