
**RFC 186212 - MCS - Install Aporeto Zero Trust Network Security Enforcement in PROD**

Wednesday October 9 at 9am

AdvSol will be installing a new network security solution [Aporeto](https://github.com/BCDevOps/platform-services/tree/master/security/aporeto) into the production cluster. All existing applications will be assigned default `NetworkSecurityPolicy` objects that will allow the same network traffic as currently supported by the application - between pods in the project, between pods and the API server (for builds), and between pods and the internet. This will ensure that there will be **no impact on the existing projects**.

If you have any questions or concerns about the install, please contact the Next Gen Security Project team at <olena.mitovska@gov.bc.ca>
