**What is happening?**

RFC CHG0018703 - MCS PROD - Update Trident to version 20.07.1

Updating the trident pod to new version to address some iscsi bugs noted earlier.

**When?**

Starting at Thursday October 8th @ 05:00 PM and finishing as late as October 8th @ 07:00 PM

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

Yes, We expect a **short interruption to the ability to provision new netapp volumes** as the pods are upgraded. Historically the outage is under a minute and can be quickly rolled back in the event of problems.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No, existing pods/volumes will be unaffected by this change. Monitor your pods for anything unusual but this change should only have an impact on deploying new volumes.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
