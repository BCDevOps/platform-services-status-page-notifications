
**RFC187849 MCS - Apply new quotas for NetApp storage**

Tuesday Nov 19 @ 13:00

Coming soon to a cluster near you! NetApp ONTAP Select based storage classes! ONTAP Select is a VM based NetApp NFS/iSCSI redundant storage cluster.

This change will run the full quota playbook on the cluster. This should be a no-op as all custom quota changes have been documented in the playbook up to this point. This will also create quotas for the new storage classes at zero. This allows the operations team to roll out the new storage classes and test them without people having access right away. Once we're ready for primetime the playbook will be run again with `20` volume, `200Gi` quotas for the new classes.

The new storage classes will be

- `netapp-file-standard` NFS based storage for standard uses
- `netapp-block-standard` iSCSI based storage for DBs
