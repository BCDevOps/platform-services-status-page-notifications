**RFC190993 CITZ - PROD MCS - Install Aqua software onto PROD cluster**

On Wednesday February 26th 2020 starting after 9:00am PST, Aqua will be installed onto the production cluster. This installation in itself will be non-impactful since it is only installing software and not activating it at this time, so no impact to end users and associated work-loads.

In the near future, additional communications from the Next Gen App Security Team will be posted regarding the software that is being installed and how it will be used going forward by involved stakeholders.
