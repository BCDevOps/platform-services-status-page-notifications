# New storage provider!

We have a new storage provider in the pathfinder cluster!  You will now be able to provision 2 new types of storage for your project: 

**netapp-file-standard**: Will become the new default storageClass and can be used for most of your storage needs.
**netapp-block-standard**: Will become the new recommended storage for applications that require block access to persistent storage.

These storageClasses are available immediately with appropriate project storage quotas.  We will be reducing quota in the gluster-file, gluster-file-db and gluster-block storageClasses to restrict new volumes of these storage classes, but no existing volumes of these types will be affected.  (Note: a reduction in the gluster storage quota for your project will NOT remove access to existing PVCs, however provisioning new PVCs in those storageClasses may be restricted.)
