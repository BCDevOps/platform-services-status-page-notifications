Upgrade the logging stack to pick up the latest bug fixes and security patches.

**When?**

Starting at 9am and completing before 5pm.

- Silver June 11th

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

No impact to apps on the clusters.

During the maintenance Kibana may go down for a few mintues as it is upgraded. Logs may be delayed in showing up in Kibana as the cluster re-syncs itself.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
