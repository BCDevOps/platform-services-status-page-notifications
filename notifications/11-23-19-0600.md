**RFC186326 and RFC186291 - PROD MCS - Upgrade Openshift Container Storage to 3.11.4 and OS Patching**

Work starts Saturday November 23 at 6am PDT.

AdvSol will be starting the upgrade of the production Containerized Storage (Gluster) on the mentioned date, and to reduce the amount of downtime, am combining the quarterly OS patching activities with this work as well.


The following schedule is what we intend to follow to apply both the OCS upgrade and OS patching against the Openshift production cluster.

**Saturday November 23rd** - This will be for the upgrade of the OCS server-side and OS patching against the OCS nodes. Due to requirements, heketi provisioning will be down for the entirety of this operation, and is estimated to require 8-10 hours (perhaps less - the new OCS software is meant to bring improvements).

**Sunday November 24th** - This will be for upgrading the glusterfs-fuse RPM package and OS patching on all Master nodes. Estimate amount of time should be 2-3 hours max. 

**Monday November 25th through Friday November 29th** - Upgrade glusterfs-fuse RPM and OS patching for the Infra and App nodes. OS patching in itself does not take long, but this will include needed firmware upgrades to the physical nodes.

We will update once this work has been completed, and post updates to when specific milestones are reached.
