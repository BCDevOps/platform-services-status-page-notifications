**What is happening?**

CHG0033616 Additional VLANs being added to NetApp SILVER cluster network ports

This change will add new network VLANs to network ports used by the SILVER Openshift cluster and its NetApp appliance which provides persistent storage to the cluster. This change is to help support future configuration improvements for how the NetApp appliance connects to the SILVER Openshift cluster (to be scheduled and advertised at a later date).

**When?**

This Wednesday (January 12th 2022) from 6am to 7am PST.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

No impact expected to any services provided by the SILVER Openshift cluster or the involved NetApp appliance. Confirmation of the work will be applied by Storage and Platform Operations stakeholders to confirm this expected lack of impact.

**Do I need to do anything?**

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
