**What is happening?**

CHG0052199 STMS NET - INT/CAL SIS - Install Checkpoint hotfixes and reboot SIS firewalls

The Secure Internet Service firewalls in both data centers will be rebooted.

**When?**

Starting at Wednesday Oct 18th at 2:00AM and completing before 7:00AM

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

The firewalls will be failed over a few times, interrupting long running in-progress connections to/from the public internet. Short lived connections should just route to the currently available SiS firewall. No other impact to hosted applications is expected.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
