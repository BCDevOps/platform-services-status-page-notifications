
**Aporeto Downtime & Restart**

Today (Tuesday Feb 11th 2020) at 2PM PST we will be shutting the Aporeto enforcers down for approximately one hour. This is to allow for a project team to gather a baseline of how their application preforms without Aporeto; and, it will allow for several enforcers that are experiencing a technical issue to be restarted.

During the above mentioned outage window regular workload will not be impacted, however, application(s) will not benefit from Aporeto's enhanced protection. If your application requires the high level of security provided by Aporeto please take measures to mitigate the risk to these application.

An final update will be posted in #devops-alerts once the maintenance is complete.
