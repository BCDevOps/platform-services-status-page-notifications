**What is happening?**

Adding 5 new nodes to the PROD Openshift cluster.

**When?**

Starting at Thursday April 9th @ 1500 and finishing at Thursday April 9th @ 1700

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

No, no downtime is expected at that time. The new nodes have been thoroughly tested and should not have any impact on existing projects or pods.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
