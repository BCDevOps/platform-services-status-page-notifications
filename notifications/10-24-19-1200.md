**RFC 186861 - PROD MCS - Test and add four new app nodes to the Openshift cluster**

Thursday October 24 at 12pm PDT.

AdvSol will be running the vendor playbook responsible for adding new app nodes into the PROD Openshift cluster, with the end result of providing additional capacity for new workloads and reducing density of workload per node.

The initial intake of the new nodes will not have them available right away - we will be putting the four new nodes into a separate quarantine zone that will allow us to properly test and confirm the nodes work as expected. 

Once testing has completed, we are aiming at putting the four new nodes into service to take on production workloads first thing next Monday morning (October 28 2019).

We will update once this work has been completed.
