CHG0056724 Interior will start Sunday March 24th at 6:00am

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

CHG0057578 Calgary and CHG0056724 Interior will involve a failover of the load balancers in those datacenters. Gold DR in Calgary, then Silver and Gold in the Interior will be affected. Failovers are expected to be non-impactful but may cause long running TCP connections to close.

CHG0055412 Interior is for the management interfaces, which have no impacts on production workloads.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
