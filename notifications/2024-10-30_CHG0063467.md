**What is happening?**

CHG0063467 STMS NET - F5 software upgrade - Calgary and Kamloops STMS GTM

The F5 load balancers used for Global Server Load Balancing will be patched.

**When?**

Starting at 3:30am Wednesday Oct 30th and completing by 5:30am

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

No impact is expected. The GSLB will be failed over and then failed back. There will always be one GSLB up to provide DNS results for domain lookups. It is not expected that the GSLB will fail over apps to their DR side during this change.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
