**What is happening?**

CHG0060314 CITZ MCS Emerald - Hard Prune, ETCD Defrag and Trident Upgrade
CHG0060327 CITZ MCS Emerald - Upgrade to OCP 4.14.25

Upgrade Emerald to 4.14 and add an extra IP pool to allow for more namespaces

**When?**

The prep CHG will start Sunday June 16th at 6am and finish before 9am

The main upgrade CHG will start Monday June 17th at 9am, pause each day at 5pm, and resume the next morning at 9am until complete.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

During the prep change:

- the image registry will be read-only for up to 15 minutes
- PVC operations (creation, deletion, mounting to new pods) will be unavailable while Trident is upgraded

During the main upgrade, the control plane will be upgraded (twice) and may have brief interuption to the API or web console. This will be followed by rolling node drains to update the node operating systems.

If node drains are stalled by degraded applications PodDisruptionBudgets the Product Owner and Tech Lead will be emailed with a 1 hour time limit to resolve the issue or have the PDB deleted.

**Do I need to do anything?**

Monitor your applications to ensure they remain available as pods are drained from nodes and restared onto other nodes.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
