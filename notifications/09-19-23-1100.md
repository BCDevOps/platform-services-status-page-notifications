**What is happening?**

CHG0052416 MCS Emerald - Switch DNS resolvers to Internal

We will be swapping the clusters DNS resolvers from the DMZ scoped ones to the internal scoped ones. This will allow pods to look up `*.idir.bcgov` hosts.

**When?**

Starting at 10am Thursday Sept 21st and finishing before noon.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

No, no downtime is expected at that time.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
