**What is happening?**

MySC CHG0036609

Vendor request to perform Hardware Validation on OCIOPF-P-204.DMZ

**When?**

Starting at 9:00am PST on Friday February 19th 2021 and concluding before 4:00pm PST Monday February 22nd 2021.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

No impact whatsoever. The node in question has remained cordoned off and previously drained of user workloads, and will remain this way until we are confident we can put the server back into service.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No. Monitor the health of your apps during the change. Refer to [Post-Outage Application Checklist](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Post-Outage-Application-Health-Checklist) for health check tips.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
