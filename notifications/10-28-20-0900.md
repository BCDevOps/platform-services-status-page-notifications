**What is happening?**

CHG0019473 MCS - Drain pods from ociopf-p-211 and troubleshoot SAN connection

Drain pods from the node to ensure no disruption to the applications.

**When?**

Starting at Thursday Oct 28th @ 09:00 AM

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

As long as your application is designed to be highly available there should be no impact as your pods are restarted onto other hsots.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
