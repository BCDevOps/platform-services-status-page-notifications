**What is happening?**

CHG0063468 STMS NET - F5 software upgrade - Kamloops STMS Proxy

The F5 load balancers used for the Forward Proxy service will be patched.

**When?**

Starting at 6am Thursday Oct 31st and completing by 8am.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

The forward proxy is used by the Emerald cluster and apps hosted on it. Open connections will be reset during the failover and failback. Retries will connect to the active proxy.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
