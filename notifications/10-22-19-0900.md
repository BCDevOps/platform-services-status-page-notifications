**RFC 186708 - MCS - Install Aporeto Zero Trust Network Security Enforcement in PROD**

Tuesday October 22 at 9am

AdvSol will be continuing the install of a new network security solution [Aporeto](https://github.com/BCDevOps/platform-services/tree/master/security/aporeto) into the production cluster. All existing applications have been assigned default `NetworkSecurityPolicy` objects that will allow the same network traffic as currently supported by the application - between pods in the project, between pods and the API server (for builds), and between pods and the internet. This will ensure that there will be **no impact on the existing projects**.

If you have any questions or concerns about the install, please contact the Next Gen Security Project team at <olena.mitovska@gov.bc.ca>

This is a continuation of the work we started on Oct 9th. The only step remaining is to create the enforcer DaemonSet and monitor for issues.

If you have any connectivity issues once the enforcers are in place please post in #devops-sos for the team to triage.
