CHG0060947 CITZ MCS SILVER - Reduce logging level on HAProxy Routers

Rolling restart of the router pods

**When?**

Starting at 6am Thur July 4th until 9am.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

The routers will be restarted one at a time and traffic will be sent to the other live pods. Long running connections will be interupted but client side retrys will connect to a new pod.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
