**ITIMS 189667 Install renewed PROD pathfinder wildcard certificate**

On Wednesday January 15th starting after 9:00am PST the certificate for *.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca will be replaced on the master nodes as well as the router pods. The currently-installed certificate otherwise expires on January 31 2020.

API services will be restarted in sequence on each master server, but we take steps to force failover of API to another node first, so possible impact should be minimal. The web console is affected as well, a web browser refresh should address any loading issues.

We will post on #devops-alerts when this maintenance is complete.
