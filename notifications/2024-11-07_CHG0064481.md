Hi @all, your attention is needed! 

**What is happening?**

CHG0064481 CITZ MCS SILVER - Adjust max PID settings on infra nodes

This will restart the infra nodes in Silver.

**When?**

Starting at Thursday Nov 7th at 9:00am and completing before 5pm

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

Long running connections to Routes may be interrupted as the Routers restart. No other impacts are expected, for questions post in #devops-operations

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/rocketchat/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
