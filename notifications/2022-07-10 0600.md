**What is happening?**

CHG0038916 HS STRG - Upgrade ECS software Version from 3.6.2.2 to  3.7.0.2 in Calgary

Upgrading the backend of the Object Store service.

Customers reported read latency issues when the Garbage Collection (GC) job is running and Dell support recommended to update the ECS code to 3.7.0.2 to enable the GC Jobs.

**When?**

Starting at 2022-07-10 06:00:00 and finishing before 2022-07-11 07:00:00

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

No.

ECS Node updates will proceed with each of the 6 being done in series, followed by checks before moving along. The solution design tolerates one node down without any disruption of services, so even as nodes reboot to finalize their updates, clients should see no service loss. Similarly, replication should not be impacted at any time.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No.

**This change is managed by the Storage Team, so no updates will be posted here during the change.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Contact 77000 if you have any issues with Object Store during or after the change.
