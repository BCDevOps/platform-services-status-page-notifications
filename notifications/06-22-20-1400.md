INC0037756 MCS - Missing application logs

Some users are reporting that Kibana is missing logs for their applications.

AdvSol has opened a case with Red Hat to investigate.

**When?**

The first report was at 22:00 on June 17th.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

No impact to running applications, just missing logs. Logs should be getting buffered on the servers and will be processed once this is fixed.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**
