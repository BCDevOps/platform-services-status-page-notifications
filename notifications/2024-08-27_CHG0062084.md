CHG0062084 CITZ - EMERALD - Drain VM nodes to support VMWare ESXi host maintenance

Node drains in support of the underlying ESXi upgrades performed quarterly as part of required maintenance.

**When?**

Starting at 9am on Tuesday Aug 27th and completing before 5pm Friday Aug 30th.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

Nodes will be cordoned and drained with pods being restarted onto other nodes one at a time.

**Do I need to do anything?**

Monitor your applications for disruptions. Well designed applications should be able to tolerate the pod restarts without issue.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
