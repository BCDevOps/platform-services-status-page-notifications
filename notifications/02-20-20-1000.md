
**Aporeto Upgrade**

On Thursday (Feb 20th, 2020) at 10AM PST we will upgrade Aporeto. This upgrade will fix an issue in an internal component as well as introduce functionality need to facilitate better security at pod startup.

The above mentioned outage will take approximately 15 minutes. During this window regular workload **will be** impacted as follows:
- Any in-flight network connections will be terminated; and
- Applications will not benefit from Aporeto's enhanced protection because Aporeto will be off.

If your application requires the high level of security provided by Aporeto please take measures to mitigate the risk to these application. A final update will be posted in #devops-alerts once maintenance is complete.
