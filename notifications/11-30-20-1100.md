**What is happening?**

CHG0020612 MCS SILVER - Change SNAT settings of *.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca

Per the [ZH ticket](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/platform-experience-5bb7c5ab4b5806bc2beb9d15/issues/bcdevops/openshift4-rollout/465), currently the source IP of connections to the OpenShift Ingress Router are being masked by SNAT. This change will remove the SNAT setting and allow the correct IP to be tracked in the HTTP header X-Forwarded-For: passed to applications.

**When?**

Starting at Wednesday Dec 2 @ 06:00 AM.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

No impact is expected.

**Do I need to do anything?**

Nope.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
