CHG0064176 - CITZ - MCS - Drain and reboot SILVER and GOLD DELL nodes to apply a firmware update

**When?**

Starting at 9AM Tuesday October 29th and completing before 4:30 PM on Thursday October 31st.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

Pods will be drained from the affected nodes, similar to OpenShift patching. The nodes will then have their firmware updated to a newer more stable version and returned to service.

Nodes:

**Do I need to do anything?**

Please monitor your apps to ensure the pods restart correctly and that your PDBs are not blocking any drains.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
