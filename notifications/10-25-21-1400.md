**What is happening?**
CHG0031006 - STMS NET - Investigate Asymmetrical routing from KAM SiS firewall

As part of ongoing troubleshooting efforts by Network regarding another Ministry having connectivity issues, this maintenance will involve a temporary change of routing of traffic through the Kamloops SiS firewall.

This change may temporarily affect open connections between Openshift clusters in Kamloops (SILVER/GOLD/KLAB) and will only last a few seconds while the changes are made.

**When?**

This Monday evening (October 25th 2021) after 7pm PDT (change window goes until 10pm PDT if needed).

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

Open network connections outside the involved clusters might be reset and need to be re-established after routing changes are made and failed back. Apps not relying on external connectivity will not be impacted.

**Do I need to do anything?**

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
