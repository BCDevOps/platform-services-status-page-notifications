**What is happening?**

CHG0054814 CITZ - MCS SILVER - Rebuild 23 VMs with smaller disks

This will drain 23 APP nodes and rebuild the nodes with the assistance of VMware using a smaller OS disk. Once the nodes are rebuilt anbd tested, they will be put back into circulation.

**When?**

Starting on January 22nd 2024 at 9:00am PST and running until February 2nd 5:00pm PST at the latest.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**
Pods hosted on  the involved nodes will be affected as workloads are drained, but the drains will be done in a serial fashion so applications designed with High Availablity in mind should remain up.

**Do I need to do anything?**

Monitor your applications during this RFC.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
