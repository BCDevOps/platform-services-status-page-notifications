
*RF185453 MCS - Add 500GB disk to registry disk*

Monday September 16 at 3:30pm PDT.

This will add more disk space to the registry pods, taking us from 1000GB to 1500GB.

No impact should be seen - the registry pods will automatically register the new disk space once the change is applied.
