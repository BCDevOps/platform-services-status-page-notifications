**What is happening?**

CHG0018982 STMS NET - Baseline code upgrade - Kamloops STMS - 5 TOR Switches - IMPACTFUL

Switches used by some OCP v3 app nodes are being patched.

**When?**

Starting at Sunday January 31st at 06:00 and running to 09:00

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

As the nodes use a redundant pair of switches no impact is expected.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
