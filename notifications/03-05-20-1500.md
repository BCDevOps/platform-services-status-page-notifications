
**Extended Aporeto Downtime**

By way of a follow-up to the earlier notice about the Aporeto outage on Tuesday (March 3rd): We have a much improved solution to roll out Aporeto updates, but, its going to take several days to codify and test (thoroughly). In the interest of stability and a buttery-smooth user experience **we are going to keep Aporeto off** until the new solution is ready; starting it now (the old way) would once again cause intermittent service disruptions to users of the platform.

If this causes you great concern, or you'd like status updates, please reach out to us in the `#devops-aporeto` channel on RocketChat. We will post additional alerts when we intend to bring Aporeto back on-line and when its up-and-running again.
