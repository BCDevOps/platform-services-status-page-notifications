
*RF185417 MCS - Add 2 vCPU to each master node*

Monday September 16 at 9am PDT.

This will increase the total vCPU for each master node from 6 to 8, thus allowing additional capacity for future API/etcd workloads when we add more app nodes.

Each VM will be updated in turn, care taken to fail over API workloads to the other nodes before taking action.
