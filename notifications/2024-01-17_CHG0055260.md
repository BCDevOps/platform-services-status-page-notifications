**What is happening?**

CHG0055260 STMS NET - Upgrade Calgary DMZ firewalls 15600 series firewalls with new 16200 Series firewalls

[MySC TIB](https://ociomysc.service-now.com/sp?id=kb_article&sys_id=b9fddabadb5f759005341949139619a9)

**When?**

Starting at Wednesday January 17th at 2:30AM and running until 5:30AM

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

The Gold DR cluster uses DNS servers that are in the Calgary DMZ. During the change the DMZ firewalls will go offline breaking our connection to those DNS resolvers.

Applications that need to resolve DNS entries will get timeouts or errors during the outage.

**Do I need to do anything?**

Once the change is over, verify your application is healthy and working again. You may also want to join the testing conference call listed in the [TIB](https://ociomysc.service-now.com/sp?id=kb_article&sys_id=b9fddabadb5f759005341949139619a9).

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
