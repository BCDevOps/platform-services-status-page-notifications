**Repo Mountie New Feature Launch**

Developers! This Thursday Jan 16, 2020 we’ll be launching a new Repo Mountie feature designed to promote security in all platform projects/apps. This feature will impact **all repos in the GitHub bcgov organization**.

Once the feature is enabled, the Repo Mountie bot will create a friendly pull request for each repo, inviting teams to self-declare their current STRA and PIA status (complete, in-progress, exempt, etc.). The pull request will also provide detailed information on how to communicate with the bot. The collected STRA and PIA data will help MISOs assess compliance and prioritize areas for further support.

As always, please post your questions or comments to **#devops-security** channel in RocketChat as we’re constantly on the look-out for ways to improve your experience on the Platform!
