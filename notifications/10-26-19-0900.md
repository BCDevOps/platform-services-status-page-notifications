**RFC 184443 - PROD MCS - Upgrade Openshift to version 3.11.146**

Saturday October 26 at 9am PDT.

AdvSol will be starting the upgrade of our production Openshift cluster this Saturday, with the intent of performing these following likely-impactful pieces of the upgrade on that date.

- Upgrade the backplane, which comprises of the core components of the cluster (etcd, api, web console). This may be considered impactful since the upgrade will be heavy against the API services involved. Red Hat has improved their processes to mitigate this impact, but we can no longer tender this particular portion of the upgrade during business hours.
- Upgrade the OCS nodes after completing the backplane upgrade. The impact here is during the portion of time when the gluster cluster is re-syncing itself against a restarted glusterfs pod, which can cause issues for a pod re-mounting an affected volume during that period of time.

Once these possibly-impactful upgrades are handled over the weekend, we would continue the OCP upgrade the following Monday, which will include the app nodes after confirming the four additional nodes we building out now are ready for use. 


We will update once this work has been completed, and post updates to when specific milestones are reached.
