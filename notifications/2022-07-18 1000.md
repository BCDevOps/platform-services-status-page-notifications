**What is happening?**

CHG0039384 - MCS SILVER -  Increase Elasticsearch pod's cpu request resource per vendor request

Per request from vendor support, we will be increasing the Elasticsearch Pods' CPU resource and limit on the OpenShift SILVER cluster this week. This will not impact running workloads, but during the course of the upgrade, use of Kibana for reviewing pod logs might be slower as the change progresses.

**When?**

This Tuesday morning (July 19th 2022) starting after 10:00am PDT until 12:00pm PDT.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

There will be no impact to running workloads on the SILVER cluster. This change will only affect developers making use of Kibana to view current/historic pod logs as the back-end Elasticsearch cluster catches up on missed shards during the change.

**Do I need to do anything?**

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
