**What is happening?**

CHG0031033 STMS NET - INT - F5 load balancer upgrade Interior Physical Host

This change will involve both the SILVER and GOLD clusters, and as we fail over to each upgraded F5 node, open network connections between services on the clusters to the outside network might be reset and re-established by refreshing the connection (may happen automatically for many apps).

**When?**

This Sunday (Nov 28th 2021) after 6am PST.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

Open network connections outside the involved clusters might be reset and need to be re-established after F5 fail-over is performed (this happens twice). Apps not relying on external connectivity will not be impacted.

**Do I need to do anything?**

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
