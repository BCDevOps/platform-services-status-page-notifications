**What is happening?**

CHG0021598 MCS PROD - Drain nodes 205 - 208 in preparation for decommission

This is for the OCP 3.11 Prod Cluster

**When?**

Starting at January 8th at 11:00am

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

Similar to patching, the nodes will be drained and pods will restart on other nodes.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
