**What is happening?**

CHG0019254 MCS SILVER - Adjust internal proxy CA Bundle

Switch from using a large CA Bundle to just the EnTrust Root CA

**When?**

Starting at 13:00 on Oct 27th and running as late as 17:00.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

Yes. This change will trigger a rolling reboot of all the nodes in the cluster. Each app node will be evacuated and rebooted one at a time. Pods will be moved between hosts as they are drained.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action is required. If your app is highly available then no impacts should be noticed.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
