CHG0022285 MCS SILVER - Revert API workaround

Previously we had implemented a workaround solution based on https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5448851

Since upgrading to v4.5.20 in 2020Q4, this is no longer required. This also needs to be removed before upgrading to v4.6.

**When?**

Starting at Thursday January 28th at 09:00 until complete, expected to take 30 min or less.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

This will cause the API server pods to restart one at a time. There may be some short interruptions to the API as the Load Balancer fails over, but should be minimal.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action is required.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
