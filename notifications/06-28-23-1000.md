**What is happening?**

CHG0049908 STMS NET - CAL/INT - Arista switch OS upgrades

This is an upgrade of the WAN routers in each datacenter. The WAN routers sit between the OpenShift clusters and the public internet.

**When?**

Starting at Sunday July 16th @ 06:00 AM and finishing by 9am

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

No impact is expected as each of the 4 switches will be upgraded one at a time, failing over between them as needed. Calgary will be done first, followed by Kamloops. Platform Ops will be on the change call and testing during the changes.

**Do I need to do anything?**

Nope

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
