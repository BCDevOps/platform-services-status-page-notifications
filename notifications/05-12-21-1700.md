## What is happening?

RocketChat is being upgrade form 2.4 to 3.14.

## When?

Starting Wednesday at 5 PM PDT lasting for approximately 25min.

## What is the impact?

This upgrade will only impact Rocket Chat. During the upgrade Rocket Chat will be scaled down so that a clean backup can be taken. Then the server will be scaled back up with the new image. When started it will take about 5 minutes to upgrade the database.

It is expected Rocket Chat will be unavailable for 10-20 minutes during the upgrade. If problems persist an additional 15 minutes may be required to restore a backup.

## Do I need to do anything?

If you have any bots or other automations that use use the Rocket Chat API check to make sure they are working 
as expected.
