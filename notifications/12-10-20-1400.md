CHG0020790 - MCS PROD 3.11 NetworkManager dns adjustment

Update all nodes with a Network Manager configuration file.

**When?**

Starting at 1400 on December 10th.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

No. This has been tested in 3.11 LAB and no impact was noted. It is intended to correct an issue where pods experience intermittent but regular DNS lookup errors.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action is required. If you have been affected by the intermittent DNS lookup issue, please monitor and if possible report if this change has corrected or reduced the occurrence of this problem.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
