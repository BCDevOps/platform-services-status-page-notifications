CHG0064188 CITZ - SILVER MCS - Decommission six worker nodes

Six worker nodes in the Openshift SILVER cluster will be decommissioned and replaced with newer hardware. Workloads on the old hardware will be drained as part of this maintenance.

**When?**

Starting at 9:00am PDT this Thursday October 31st 2024 and completing before 4:00pm the same day.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

Workloads residing on the old hardware will be drained onto different nodes, and done so in a serial fashion so that Highly Available applications should not be impacted. Applications with no workloads on the involved nodes will not be affected at all.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required beyond the monitoring of your applications.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
