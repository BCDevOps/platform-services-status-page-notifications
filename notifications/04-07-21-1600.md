**What is happening?**

CHG0024713 CITZ - MCS PROD - Drain nodes 191-194 in preparation for decommission

Move the user workloads off of these servers so we are ready to decommission the hosts as the next step. The Openshift cluster now has sufficient free space to accommodate the removal of these hosts.

**When?**

Starting at Thursday April 8th at 09:00 am PDT running for up to 7 hours.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

No impact to apps is expected. Node drains are performed regularly as part of routine maintenance and applications have been designed to be highly available. Pods on the affected nodes will be removed and spun up on other nodes.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in Rocket.Chat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](
