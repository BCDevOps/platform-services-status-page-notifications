
**Rocket.Chat Service Restored**

Today (Thursday Feb 13th 2020) at ~4:00PM PST we were able to partially restore the rocket.chat service.  We are still experiencing some database performance issues, and are continuing to investigate.  While service has been restored and some performance improvements made, we expect a slower experience until the performance issue is more fully resolved.

We will be tracking our investigation in the following issue:
