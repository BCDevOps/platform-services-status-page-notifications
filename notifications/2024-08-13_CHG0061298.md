**What is happening?**

CHG0061298 STMS NET - INT - Replace ToR switches - ESXi  MCS Cluster (A400, A403, A404, A406, A407,  A408)

This will replace the Top of Rack switches used by the ESXi nodes hosting several OpenShift VMs.

**When?**

Starting at 6pm Tues Aug 13th and completing before midnight.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

No impact to the platform or apps is expected. VMs will be live migrated between ESXi nodes as each ESXi node then gets its network connections moved to a new switch and tested.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required. Platform Ops will be monitoring cluster health through the duration of the change.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
